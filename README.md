<h1>Canvas Fun</h1>
<p>The code loads a 600x600 canvas and creates 20x20 squares when clicked. The squares travel at a random speed and direction until they hit a wall. When they hit a wall, they get a new random speed away from the wall.</p>

<p>Please comment if you have any questions about the code</p>
